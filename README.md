# Power-BI
My first Power BI Dashboard.
This Power BI Sales Dashboard provides a clear and interactive overview of business performance. 
It displays key metrics such as total revenue, total profit, and total sales, along with visualizations to analyze sales trends over months, regional sales distribution, top-selling products, and profit by product category. 
The dashboard also includes a date filter, allowing users to explore and analyze sales data within a specific time range for deeper insights.
